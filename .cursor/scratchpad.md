# 3D Print System Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to develop a Flask-based 3D print job management system tailored for an academic/makerspace environment. The core goal is to replace manual or ad-hoc systems with a centralized, digital platform that streamlines the workflow from student submission through staff approval to print completion. Key features include robust file lifecycle management (preserving original uploads while tracking sliced files), job status tracking, email notifications, thumbnail generation for previews, and a custom protocol handler to allow staff to open 3D files directly in local slicer applications from the web interface. The system is designed to support operations across two computers via a shared network storage solution and a single Flask application instance serving the system. (Ref: masterplan.md Sections 1, 2.1, 4.1)

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1.  **Multi-Computer File & Database Access:** Ensuring consistent and reliable file access across two computers via shared network storage (`masterplan.md` Section 4.1.1) and managing the SQLite database access through a single server instance to prevent corruption (`masterplan.md` Section 4.1.2). The choice of a single Flask server simplifies database concurrency.
2.  **Direct File Opening (`SlicerOpener.py`):** Implementing the custom URL protocol (`3dprint://`) and the `SlicerOpener.py` helper application (`masterplan.md` Section 4.2, 4.3).
    *   **Security:** Requires robust security validation within `SlicerOpener.py` to strictly ensure only files within designated shared storage subdirectories can be opened, preventing path traversal or other unauthorized file access. This is a V1 priority.
    *   **Error Handling & User Feedback:** `SlicerOpener.py` must provide clear, user-facing error messages (e.g., via simple GUI popups) for issues like file not found, network errors, access denied, or security validation failures. This is a V1 priority.
    *   **Logging:** `SlicerOpener.py` should perform basic local logging of file access attempts (URI received, success/failure, reason for failure). This is a V1 priority.
    *   **Network Dependency:** The feature inherently depends on a stable network connection to the shared storage. Offline access is out of scope for V1; manual file copying is the fallback if the network or protocol handler fails. This is an accepted V1 trade-off.
    *   **File Locking/Concurrency:** True file locking to prevent simultaneous edits by different staff members is complex. Given the anticipated workflow and small team size, this is a V2 consideration. Slicer software might offer some inherent protection, but this is not guaranteed. The risk of data overwrite in V1 is low but acknowledged.
    *   **Installation & Updates:** `SlicerOpener.py` and its associated protocol registration require manual installation on each staff computer. Updates will also be manual for V1.
3.  **File Lifecycle Management:** Accurately tracking original student uploads versus staff-modified/sliced files, ensuring the correct "authoritative" file is used at each job stage, and managing file movements between status-based directories (e.g., `Uploaded/`, `Pending/`, `ReadyToPrint/`) (`masterplan.md` Section 3.4). Standardized file naming is crucial.
4.  **Email Notifications & Student Confirmation:** Implementing reliable email sending for various job stages and managing the token-based student confirmation workflow for print jobs (`masterplan.md` Sections 2.1, 3.3, 3.4).
5.  **Thumbnail Generation:** Integrating a library like Trimesh for thumbnail generation and gracefully handling potential failures (`masterplan.md` Section 2.1, 3.1 services/thumbnail_service.py).
6.  **Deployment & Configuration:** Ensuring path consistency for shared storage across machines and correctly deploying the Flask app, WSGI server, and the `SlicerOpener.py` tool (`masterplan.md` Section 5.3).
7.  **User Interface for Complex Workflow:** Designing clear UIs for student submission, staff dashboard interactions (including modals for approval/rejection), and administrative overrides (`masterplan.md` Section 3.4 UI/UX descriptions).
8.  **Flash Message & UI Polish Issues (Task 4a - URGENT):** User-reported UX problems requiring immediate attention:
    *   **Redundant Flash Messages:** "Please log in to access the staff dashboard" message appears on login page where it's redundant, creating poor UX.
    *   **Inappropriate Flash Message Display:** Flash messages may be appearing inappropriately across multiple pages.
    *   **Duplicate Content:** Minimum charge consent text appears twice on submission form, causing confusion.
    *   **Challenge:** Must fix these UI issues without breaking existing functionality, authentication flow, or form validation.
